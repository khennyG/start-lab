13,"If there is anything else you want us to know about why you have opted not to use or include AI tools in your courses, please describe below.","The metaphor I give to students is that they are exercising and building a skill. If they were lifting weights, they wouldn't have a robot lift the weights for them. With writing, or with their education more generally, they have bought some time by going to university to practice skills that they will use for the rest of their life, and they have professors that will be more sympathetic to their goal to learn than any future boss. It would be a shame to waste that. 
AI is a very useful tool for automating menial tasks. But if they feel that the practice necessary for their education is a menial task, then university is probably not a good investment.
In my class, I have encouraged students to discuss how they use AI, and what are potential good uses for the technology. I have liked this approach, because it gets students to be open about their use of the technology, both so that creative uses can be encouraged, and so that problematic use can be identified and flagged.
For example, some students have used AI to help skim large documents (e.g., theses) for sections relevant to their research question, which I think is a good use. Whereas other students have used AI to help reword passages to beat TurnItIn (a student admitted to this!). I want to encourage students to be intentional about their use of AI to help automate time consuming or menial labor in pursuit of independent work. That means most uses of AI will be pretty minimal, and I would discourage it entirely in the context of drafting and writing."

I show them the prompt I used to get Claude to build the tool and then the language Claude used (e.g., ""realistic"" instead of ""real"") that hinted that the underlying structure did not use real data, as I had requested. After further inquiry Claude admitted the data were simulated, not real. We discussed as a class the difference between information Claude was trained on, vs information that can be found using search engines. I then had the students dig into the primary literature to see whether Claude's simulations were accurate or not for their site.  I also allow Claude to be used to help break down complex primary literature and clarify things that are unclear to help students clearly present results from the primary literature to the rest of the class, however if Claude is used, the students are required to post the transcript of their interactions.

17,"If you answered other in the previous question, describe other reasons that you have decided not to use AI in your teaching and instruction.","LLMs are bullshit generators, in the technical sense of the term -- they fundamentally obstruct the ability to check their sources and their validity.  All statements, true and false and everything in between, are equally valid-looking, and certainly the LLM will tell you everything it says is true even when it's false.  I suppose this goes to ""accuracy concerns"" but it's more fundamental to the architecture than that, because LLMs are inherently stochastic.

I'm also familiar with the economic reasons that AI has been marketed with such force (roughly, the tech industry needed a new bubble to pump up stock prices and chase growth) -- despite falling short of most of the promises that have been made about it and despite being shoved into every conceivable nook and cranny of existing computer technology even when it makes no sense.  As such, it's hard not to be cynically aware of the manipulation going on whenever anyone is talking about how great AI is.

I don't use AI in my teaching because I have no need to.  Anything that an LLM could do, I can either do better myself (e.g., writing about the material I am teaching, generating examples for my classes) or there exist much better tools for (e.g., doing simple or complex mathematical calculations, typesetting my work)."
17,"If there is anything else you want us to know about why you have opted not to use or include AI tools in your courses, please describe below.","There has never been a way to push a magic button to see ""the answers"" to all of your homework before that has been so easily and widely accessible.  (Or at least, to see something that plausibly imitates answers to all of your homework.)  Learning only happens when students do the work themselves -- it forces them to look at the things they've been told from new angles, to go back to the results they've seen and ask ""what are the ideas here?  How can I use them in a different way?"".

The ease with which students can now short-circuit all of the opportunities for actual learning is a huge problem for me as an educator.  We solved (at least partly) the ""calculator problem"" by assigning students problems where the task is not just to perform a calculation, but to use the calculation to do something bigger, and where applying the concepts is the fundamental goal, rather than just getting the result of a computation.  But genAI makes it impossible to create tasks like this.  What kind of assignment could we create for people learning a new skill for the first time that will help them learn the concepts, and simultaneously is not something you could just type into chatGPT?  (Even if we can write problems that chatGPT consistently does incorrectly or is incapable of doing for whatever reason, why should our assignment and learning design now be dictated by whatever gaps remain in this tool's abilities?)

The lure of having the answers available is just so, so tempting, and I really have a hard time blaming students for getting addicted to something designed to hook them.  Because the systems, and all of the billions of dollars already spent on the associated marketing, *are* designed that way."

35,"If there is anything else you want us to know about why you have opted not to use or include AI tools in your courses, please describe below.","I genuinely abhor AI and think it is a blight on our students' development and cognition, with limited applications in fields like computer science. There is essentially zero use-case for it in Project Lab (a course based on developing foundational skills, many of which are hands-on), but I have seen a lot of terribly inappropriate AI usage by students who often receive conflicting instructions from their other courses. Misuse of AI in Project Lab has included using it to perform lab math or project planning (with inaccurate and often contradictory results), using it to write research papers or homework assignments wholesale, and using it to ""give me papers when I was struggling to find anything to support my conclusions."" This last example has occurred more than once and is incredibly disturbing to me, because it is antithetical to the scientific method and resulted in students citing ""evidence"" which was fabricated by AI. I have worked very hard in the past year to develop an approach that educates students on proper uses of AI, which include spelling, grammar, and clarity checks that do NOT involve replacing one's own words with AI-generated text. This system has been successful--during my three 2025 semesters I saw a drop in detectable AI usage rates on the final papers from 40% to 15% to 0%--but it has also been a considerable increase in my workload. Moreover, I refuse to use it for feedback on assignments not only because I do not trust it to do so accurately, but because my students are paying a lot of money to access and learn from my own expert human knowledge. I understand that AI is here to stay and that we must all work to educate our students on it as best we can, and in fact I have consulted with family members who are AI engineers to further learn about its applications and limitations. It is not that I lack confidence in using AI or understanding of how to use it, but rather that I am extremely concerned about the ways in which it is blunting the formation of foundational skills, and I am frustrated by NEU's lack of policy guidance on the topic."

Using AI without these skills will give them tons of erroneous information. Moreover, it seems to me we're pressured to jump on the AI bandwagon without any of us being experts in this area. It is the wrong approach for us to convey to students that we're teaching them to be at the leading edge of AI usage when most of us are novices in this area as well. I worry we're giving them the false confidence of becoming literate AI user and that many will soon fail while also not having the requisite AI-independent training."

Based on summer trainings I have plans for this year, but they are not enacted yet. Two key courses for me this fall are BIOC 4900 (and associated individual instruction courses) and BIOL 2299. For the BIOC courses I have redone my materials to clarify acceptable vs. unacceptable uses of AI in research and research+capstone. For BIOL 2299 I was hoping that we would coordinate sections and discuss appropriate AI uses for freshmen but we did not. I am still considering how to guide students on appropriate uses of AI when crafting a poster from an article that they do not understand well (where the AI temptations will certainly be there...) There is a lot of potential for AI use in brainstorming ideas for (e.g.) how to create an informative methods flowchart."

I don't see a big issue with 'AI cheating' on the lab projects in this course, since they have to deomonstrate ability to work with particular datasets.  In the long run, it seems clear that AI will be an important tool that students will be able to use, and I think I do need to come to grips with it soon, for example in deciding whether it still makes sense to continue to assign 6-8 page term papers in my other classes, or how to tell whether a term paper is an AI product or was written by the student in each case.  I'm not opposed to learning how to create and run learning exercises within, say ENVR 2310 Earth Materials lectures, that shows students some useful ways of using AI in a not-cheating way, but I'm also not clear whether AI-generated copy is as reliable as them reading peer-reviewed literature... and around we go.  I speak from the perspective of someone who started at NU before there were cell phones or computers on (most) faculty desks (1980), looks like this trend is probably here to stay.  I will stay tuned for ongoing developments and discussion opportunities."

45,Reasons_Not_Using,"Anecdotally, most of my students start the semester following my guidelines of not using AI on assessments.  It is my sense that students who feel that they are struggling after the midterm often turn to AI even though it is against course rules.  Also, I was surprised that undergraduates do not universally love AI and were very receptive to my discussion of how AI use might prevent them from learning basic skills that they need for more advanced applications.  In short, so far, it has been less of an obstacle than I had thought it would be in the classroom."

AI tools will be detrimental to my students learning. I teach 2000-L courses. My students need to build their foundational knowledge in the discipline. If they outsource simple tasks like synthesizing or summarizing literature or readings, explaining concepts in their own words, writing drafts of papers - how are they going to grow as experts in their field? I think that the AI tools can be helpful to experts (to what degree is a different story) but experts have the foundational knowledge and the skills to critically analyze and evaluate the output they get from the tools. Our students are novices. They are not ready to use the tools in helpful ways. And there was the MIT study published this summer that showed that AI tools can be detrimental to learning: https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/your-brain-on-chatgpt/overview/
I think that as a unit, we need to sit down and have discussions about the learning our students need to do in the science disciplines and where the AI tools fit. We need to decide, from a curriculum and student-centered learning point of view, when these tools are appropriate, optional or should be completely prohibited for students in our classes. We need to have clear guidelines for students and faculty. It is not an easy task and we do no have enough data but I am certain we can use our knowledge on how people learn to come up with good and concrete guidelines. "
